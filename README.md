# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from five Excel files provided for this project. The focus is on analyzing and optimizing staffing and scheduling data and also on purchase frequency and correlation of the NPS indicator . The repository includes five Jupyter Notebook scripts, each with a specific purpose.

## Files in the Repository

### Scripts

1. **data_cleaning_opa.ipynb**

Purpose: Cleaning and preprocessing the raw data from the Excel files to ensure consistency, remove errors, and prepare it for analysis.

2. **data_deep_schedule.ipynb**

Purpose: Detailed staffing analysis, focusing on: Shift management, Seasonal trends, Types of staff required, Scheduling optimization to balance workforce efficiency.

3. **umemployeed.ipynb**

Purpose: Additional analysis on unemployment-related data, Overstaffing and understaffing insights and other relevant workforce metrics.

4. **receipts-visitors.ipynb**

Purpose: Analysis of peak hours per day and average traffic and sales per month for each store separately for perception of buying behaviour.

5. **nps_visitors_receipts_per_store**

Purpose: Comparison of NPS and purchase rate per store and general comparison of traffic and sales between all stores to find differences and patterns.

## Data Files

The project analyzes five Excel files provided as input datasets. These files contain:
1. **Customer Satisfaction Files**: Four separate files, each representing data for different stores with Satisfaction scores.
2. **Visitors and Operations File**: A consolidated file containing data for all stores, including: Visitor counts, Receipt data, Employee timetables.

## Key Features

**Data Cleaning**: Handles inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues in the raw data.

**Staffing Analysis**: Provides insights into workforce requirements, inefficiencies, and optimization strategies.

**Scheduling Optimization**: Helps in creating optimal schedules that minimize costs while addressing seasonal and operational demands.

**Analysis of purchase frequency and correlation of the NPS indicator**


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Ensure that you have access to the five Excel data files as described above. Without these files, the scripts will not function correctly.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook files in your preferred environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code).

5. Run the scripts in the following order:

  - data_cleaning_opa.ipynb
  
  - data_deep_schedule.ipynb
  
  - umemployeed.ipynb

  - receipts-visitors.ipynb

  - nps_visitors_receipts_per_store

## Results

The analysis provides actionable comparative insights into costumer satisfaction , sales staffing and scheduling challenges.
